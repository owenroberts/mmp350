title: User Interaction Flow Chart
week: 9
---

<div class="slide">
	<p>A User Interaction Flow Chart is a simple diagram of the path that a user will take through your web application.</p>
	<p>Creating a UI Flow Chart requires the designer to adopt the point of view of a user and plot how a user will interact with the website.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>A UI Flow Chart helps the designer think of everything that needs to be made for the site to be fully functional and offer a straight forward user experience.</p>
	<p>Every link, button and interaction should be documented in the UI Flow Chart.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Any drawing or graphics software can be used to create a simple UI Flow Chart.  We will use Google Draw as an example.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Symbols</h2>
	<p>There are three main symbols we will use for the UI flow chart.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Rectangle + label</h2>
	<img src="home.png" alt="">
	<p>Any page should be represented by a rectangle with a label.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Arrow + label</h2>
	<img src="login.png" alt="">
	<p>An arrow represents a user interaction, clicking on a button, link, form or other.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Diamond + label</h2>
	<img src="auth.png" alt="">
	<p>A diamond shape represents a choice for the program.  In this case, the choice is whether the user authentication is valid.  If not then the user will either need to create a profile or try again.  If they are then they will be sent either back to the home page, or a user profile page, or another part of the document.</p>
