<div class="slide">
	<p>Last class we looked at changing the layout of the web app for different device and screen sizes.</p>
	<p>Does our typography also need to be updated?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>When reading on your phone is the screen closer or farther away then reading something on a computer?  Most likely, it will be a little closer, in which case the type face may appear larger relative to the screen space.</p>
	<p>A good rule of thumb is to hold your phone at the distance you would normally read with your computer in the background.  Does the font size look relatively the same?  If not, we can add a media query to change the size.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex" data-lang="css">@media (max-width: 400px) {
	body {
		font-size: 14px;
		line-height: 1.2;
	}
}</div>
	<p>Here, instead of updating specific elements of the page, we can change the baseline for the <code>font-size</code> and <code>line-height</code>.  If using <code>em</code> values, the rest of the page will update accordingly.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Fluid type</h2>
	<p>Other than <code>font-size</code>, another component of readability is the number of characters in a line.  There are different rules of thumb as to how many characters should be on one line of text.  Some say <note>45 - 75</note>.  Some specify <note>66</note> as the ideal.  Some say as many as <note>90</note> is acceptable.</p>
	<p>As designers, we can these values to get a sense of a baselines, and then use our eyes to confirm.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>The Wayne Gretzky quote I've been using is exactly 66 characters.</p>
	<p>The number of characters depends on the <code>font-size</code> and paragraph <code>width</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>At <code>1em</code> the line doesn't take up a whole line in the paragraph.</p>
	<style>
		#fluid-1 {
			font-size: 1em;
		}
	</style>
	<div class="post">
		<div class="post-text" id="fluid-1">I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We can change the width to fix it.</p>
	<style>
		#fluid-2 {
			font-size: 1em;
			width: 460px;
			margin: 0 auto;
		}
	</style>
	<div class="post">
		<div class="post-text" id="fluid-2">I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>At <code>2em</code> there is not enough text per line.</p>
	<style>
		#fluid-3 {
			font-size: 2em;
		}
	</style>
	<div class="post">
		<div class="post-text" id="fluid-3">I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We don't have more width so let's take it down a bit.  <code>1.35em</code> looks similar to the above example.</p>
	<style>
		#fluid-4 {
			font-size: 1.35em;
		}
	</style>
	<div class="post">
		<div class="post-text" id="fluid-4">I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Viewport sizing</h2>
	<p>The above examples show an <em>adaptive</em> approach, meaning again that a rule changes between different values at specific size or breakpoints.</p>
	<p>For a <em>responsive</em> approach, one way to approach <code>font-size</code> is using the relatively new <note>viewport</note> units: <code>vw</code> for viewport width, <code>vh</code> for viewport height.</p>
	<p>These rules can also be used in conjunction with the adaptive breakpoints.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p><code>1vw</code> is <code>1%</code> of the viewport width.</p>
	<p><code>1vh</code> is <code>1%</code> of the viewport height.</p>
	<p><code>vmin</code> and <code>vmax</code> to refer to the larger dimension for either landscape or portrait view.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="vmax-vmin.png" alt="">
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>These rules can be applied to different types of text.</p>
	<pre><code>#title {
	font-size: 4vw;
}

.post-text { 
	font-size: 3vmax;
}

.post-info {
	font-size: 2vmax;
}</code></pre>
</div>
