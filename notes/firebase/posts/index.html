	<p>Now that our user can add posts, we want to be able to display each user's posts on a separate page.</p>
	<p>To do this, we will introduce a new type of route, which uses a parameter.  Each user's page will have the same route, but their unique User ID will be used as a parameter in that route.</p>
	<p>We also need to query the database to get all of the posts for the user to display on their page.</p>
