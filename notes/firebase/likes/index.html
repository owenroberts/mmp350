title: Interacting with user content
week: 5
---

<div class="slide">
	<p>In many web applications we want to allow users to interact with one another's content.  This can take many forms, sharing, commenting, reposting.</p>
	<p>This week we're going to introduce the ability for users to "Like" posts.</p>	
	<p>To implement this feature, we need to add buttons for users to interact with and entries in the database to track the users who have "liked a post.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>To implement this feature we're going to add some more code to the <note>js/posts.js</note> script, in the <code>createPost</code> function.</p>
	<p>In order to keep track of "likes" and prevent users from spamming likes, we're going to need to know both the user who liked the post as well as the user who posted the post.</p>
	<p>Only signed in users will be able to like posts, and once they're signed in we'll use their <code>uid</code> as a way to track likes.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<p>To start, we need to modify our <code>postRef</code> event and <code>createPost</code> function a little bit.</p>
	<p>In order to add "Likes" back to the database, we need to know the key value of each post.</p>
	<p>We can add another argument to the <code>createPost</code> function and get the post key from the <code>snapshot</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">postRef.on('child_added', function(snapshot) {
	createPost(snapshot.key, snapshot.val());
});</div>
	<br>
	<div class="ex">function createPost(key, post) {
	// create post code
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Like interface</h2>
	<p>To create the interface for users to "like" and then "unlike" posts, we need to add another section to our post with two buttons and span to display the posts.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">const likeDiv = document.createElement('div');
likeDiv.classList.add('likes');

const likeBtn = document.createElement('button');
likeBtn.classList.add('like-btn');
likeBtn.textContent = "Like";

const unlikeBtn = document.createElement('button');
unlikeBtn.classList.add('unlike-btn');
unlikeBtn.textContent = "Unlike";

const displayLikes = document.createElement('span');
displayLikes.classList.add('display-likes');</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Next we add each of the elements to the likes div and then append that to the post div after everything else.</p>
	<div class="ex">likeDiv.appendChild(likeBtn);
likeDiv.appendChild(unlikeBtn);
likeDiv.appendChild(displayLikes);
// after adding <code>postText</code>, <code>postAuthor</code> and <code>postInfo</code>.
postDiv.appendChild(likeDiv);</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We also need to add event listeners to each button to call a function to like or unlike the post.</p>
	<p>The like button will add the argument <code>true</code> to like and the unlike button will use <code>false</code> to unlike.</p>
	<div class="ex">likeBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
	likeOrUnLikePost(true);
});

unlikeBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
	likeOrUnLikePost(false);
});</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Like/Unlike Function</h2>
	<p>In this code, the <code>currentUser</code> is the one who is doing the likeing.  We're going to set the name of the user to a reference in the database, creating a new child called <code>likes</code>.</p>
	<p>By storing a reference using the user's id that is rewritten with the <code>set</code> function, this will prevent the user from liking more than once, because firebase won't store multiple references with the same key.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">function likeOrUnLikePost(isLike) {
	if (firebase.auth().currentUser) {
		const uid = firebase.auth().currentUser.uid;
		const postRef = firebase.database().ref('posts').child(key).child('likes').child(uid);
		let likePromise;
		if (isLike) {
			likePromise = postRef.set(true);
		} else {
			likePromise = postRef.remove();
		}
		likePromise.then(function() {
			location.reload();
		});
	} else {
		alert("Log in to like posts");
	}
}</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Once the like is recorded in the database, we want to reload the page to show the new likes.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<h2>Display likes</h2>
	<p>Now that we have some likes stored in the database, let's display them.</p>
	<p>To get the number of likes, we can make an array of the likes object keys, using <code>Object.keys()</code> and get the <code>length</code> from that array.</p>
	<p>If there are no likes, we simply display "0 likes".</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<div class="ex">if (post.likes) {
	displayLikes.textContent = Object.keys(post.likes).length + " likes";
} else {
	displayLikes.textContent = "0 likes";
}</div>
</div>
