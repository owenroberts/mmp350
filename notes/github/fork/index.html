<div class="slide">
	<p>For the beginning of the class we'll all be working from the same code base, but each one will be implemented using different HTML and CSS with it's own styles.</p>
	<p>In order to do this, we need to fork the repo where I've created the base app.</p>
	<p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/" target="blank">Fork a Repo ~ GitHub Tutorial</a></p>
	<p>A <note>fork</note> is a copy of a repo.  Creating a fork allows a user to make their own version of a piece of software while keeping the core functionality of the software up to date with the original project.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Start by logging into GitHub and then navigating to my BMCC GitHub page <code>github.com/owenbmcc</code>.</p>
	<p>Find the repo we created in class and then click the <note>Fork</note> button in the upper right hand corner.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>This will make a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account.</p>
	<p>To download the copy to your computer, open Terminal and clone the repo.</p>
	<pre><code>$ cd Desktop/mmp350
$ git clone https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPO_NAME_HERE
$ cd REPO_NAME_HERE</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Once the fork is cloned, print out the remotes to make sure it points to your GitHub account.</p>
	<pre><code>$ git remote -v</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>After forking, the origin repo will be on your GitHub account.</p>
	<p>To keep things up to date with the original, set the <code>upstream</code> repo to the repo I created in class.</p>
	<pre><code>$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/owenbmcc/REPO_NAME_HERE</code></pre>
	<p>Then you can grab updates in the code with this command.</p>
	<pre><code>$ git pull upstream master</code></pre>
