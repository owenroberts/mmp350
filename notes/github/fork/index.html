<div class="slide">
	<p>For the beginning of the class we'll all be working from the same templates, with CSS added on individual forks.</p>
	<p>In order to do this, we need to fork the repo where I've created the base app.</p>
	<!-- <p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/" target="blank">Fork a Repo ~ GitHub Tutorial</a></p> -->
	<p>A <note>fork</note> is a copy of a repo.  Creating a fork allows a user to make their own version of a piece of software while keeping the core functionality of the software up to date with the original project.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Start by logging into GitHub and then navigating to my BMCC GitHub page <code>github.com/owenbmcc</code>.</p>
	<p>Find the repo we created in class and then click the <note>Fork</note> button in the upper right hand corner.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<p>This will make a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account.</p>
	<p>To download the copy to your computer, open the GitHub Desktop Client application and clone the repo.</p>

	<p>Then, you can edit the code and push to your own GitHub repository.</p>
