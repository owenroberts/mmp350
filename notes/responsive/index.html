<div class="slide">
	<p><em>Responsive design</em> is the practice of designing websites that change style and layout to fit a variety of devices with different dimensions, screen densities and functionalities to create an optimal viewing experience based on a single template.  In responsive design, the rules will move fluidly between sizes, applying new properties for each style rule.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Like responsive design, <em>adaptive design</em> changes based on screen size and density, but adaptive design generally pinpoints specific breaking points or thresholds and creates designs for those points.
</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Both concepts are rooted in the idea of <em>progressive enhancement</em>, the idea that websites should be designed to provide the basic content to any device, while progressively introducing enhanced design possibilities for modern devices.</p>
	<p>Progressive enhancement starts with the content of the site, then adds visual design, and finally user interaction on top.</p>

	<h2>CSS Media Queries</h2>
	<p>To implement Mobile and Tablet sized wireframe designs, we will use media queries in CSS to set breakpoints in terms of pixel dimensions (in device width) to change the layout.</p>
