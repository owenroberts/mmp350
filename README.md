	- Final Breakdown
		- Concept (10) 
			- The theme/portfolio should be clear in concept and execution.  Include the concept in the description in the style.css file.
		- Visual Design (20) 
			- Overall Impression: does the visual design fit the concept for this theme? This is about the atmosphere and feel of the site. Much of this is conveyed by the fonts, colors and images and graphic embellishments (icons, shadows, borders etc).
			- Parts of the page are clearly visible: header, nav, content, footer etc. and the relative importance.
			- This includes support for responsive or mobile design.

		- Content (15)
			- Is the content of your portfolio appropriate for the theme?  There should be images or videos, descriptions and links (if available) for all of the projects in the portfolio.

		- Template Files (35) - These are the WordPress files we have been working on this semester.  For the theme to work correctly all of these files must be included.
			- index.php: default page. Required of all themes
			- 404.php : Shows if a page or post is now found. the only one where you donâ€™t need a content- because there is no loop
			- search.php: shows the search results
