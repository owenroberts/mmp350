##Responsive Design

**Responsive design** is the practice of designing websites that change style and layout to fit a variety of devices with different dimensions, screen densities and functionalities to create an optimal viewing experience based on a single template.  In responsive design, the rules will move fluidly between sizes, applying new dimensions to every dimension.

Like responsive design, **adaptive design** changes based on screen size and density, but adaptive design generally pinpoints specific breaking points or thresholds and creates designs for those points.

Both concepts are rooted in the idea of **progressive enhancement**, the idea that websites should be designed to provide the basic content to any device, while progressively introducing enhanced design possibilities for modern devices.
