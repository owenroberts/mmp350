#Introduction to Foundation
We’re going to look at using the Foundation grid to implement the wireframes for our site.

Start by [downloading Foundation here](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download.html/).

Foundation provides many features to make site design implementation faster.  We want to start with a custom download that includes the grid elements only.  On the Customize Page choose only the Grid and Block Grid elements and the number of columns, gutter, and max-width for your layout.  Feel free to return to the Foundation documentation to try out the other features at another time.

We’re going to go over the [documentation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/components/grid.html) for Grid and Block Grid today and use them to implement our wireframes.
